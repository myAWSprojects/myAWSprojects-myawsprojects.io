www.myawsprojects.io (under development) will be an AI based learning platform hosted on AWS (Amazon Web Services) and free to all.
Our mission is to offer AWS training to battered women, children, men, court supervised individuals, soon to be released , non-violent, non-sexual-crimes prisoners, homeless, and anyone seeking to level up. We will offer local training in Tampa, FL. at a community resource center. The online training will be newly created materials as well as some youtube videos that have been selected by our team. The key to our training is that we will prove to anyone that no matter their history or educational background, they have the power to learn and level up their life.

Why are we doing this? To honor the memory of my father and hero (Odell Keown), who was abused by his father and changes the course of his family, by never laying a finger on his children. I watched this great man take his last breath on November 28th 2019 and my goal is for his name and memory to span generations. He showed love to everyone who ever met him. Especially to my amazing mother for the 56 years they were married. As someone who dropped out of high school in the tenth grade, there is nothing this man couldn't learn or do.  He installed this in all of his children and grandchildren through love. It's my honor to show the world how amazing and carring he was. 

Below is a sample of the way we teach people to learn and remember. We will use methods like mindmaps by Tony Buzan and improved uppon by Kam Knight. These loci association to past memories that each person can draw upon to learn and most importantly, retain what they learn. Bascially, the techniques dicussed in the book by Joshua Foer, Moonwalking with Einstein. Jim Kwik's Limitless is a good read as well.  

Very basic example. More to come as we grow and get others to contribute.

What are the 6 R's of migration to the cloud?
